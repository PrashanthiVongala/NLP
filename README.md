News-Summarization:

Introduction:

Welcome to the project, "News-Summarization.In this project, we attempt to generate summaries of news articles by extracting important sentences from a news article.

Project Overview:

Summarization of content is an important research area for Natural Language Processing. Summarizing news articles is an important branch of this research. News publications like Associated Press, Bloomberg and Reuters are actively working on automating stories in different beats such as finance and sports.

Readers often don't have time to read through entire articles, and reading only the headline and sub-heading does not inform them of all the important points discussed in the article. Also, it is not possible for news publications to prepare summaries of every article they publish. So, it may be a good idea for news apps to have in-built features that can summarize articles for them.

Key Features:

1. Transormers: Transformers utilize an attention mechanism that allows them to focus on relevant parts of the input text when generating summaries. This mechanism enables them to assign varying levels of importance to different words or phrases, capturing the most salient information for inclusion in the summary.

2. Advanced NLP Techniques: Leveraging advanced language models, topic modeling using Large Pre-trained Models, and other NLP techniques, we aim to achieve high-quality and informative summaries.

3. Custom Dataset: We curate our own dataset from diverse sources, ensuring the quality and relevance of the data used for training and evaluation.

Getting Started:
To initiate your exploration of the News-Summarization Using NLP project on Google Colab, follow these steps:

Installation:

As this project has been developed in Google Colab, the installation process is streamlined. Simply open the provided Jupyter notebook (IPYNB file) in Google Colab, and the required dependencies will be automatically set up within the Colab environment.

1. Open in Colab: Click on the provided IPYNB file link, and it will open directly in Google Colab.

2. Runtime Configuration: Ensure that you have a working internet connection and select a Python runtime that supports GPU acceleration for optimal performance.

3. Download the Data: Download the news summarization data from the data folder and upload it to your colab envinirment.

4. Run All Cells: Execute the notebook cells sequentially by selecting "Runtime" -> "Run all" from the menu. This will install and configure the necessary dependencies.
